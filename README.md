What is a currying function?                                                                                                                  											It is the process of taking a function with multiple arguements and turning into a sequence of functions each with one single argemenrt. By applying currying an n-array function gets converted to a unary array function.                                                          																						example: const multi =(a,b,c) => (a+b+c)    /*Answer: 6 */                                                                                    											const curry = (a) =>(b) =>(c) =>(a+b+c)                                  																												const curry(1); /* {1+b+c} */																																							const curry (1)(2);	/* {1+2+c} */																																						const curry (1)(2)(3); /* {1+2+3 Answer:6 } */
